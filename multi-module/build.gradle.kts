        Am I doing this right? Putting "implementation" in quotes? Can't I omit the quotes and get the strong typing?
        Isn't strong typing and auto-complete the whole point of the Gradle Kotlin DSL versus the traditional
        Groovy-based build.gradle file? Well, according to the official examples, this is the right trick! https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/da613276316a21508a6e30e19d1923a312578b84/subprojects/docs/src/snippets/multiproject/dependencies-java/kotlin/build.gradle.kts#L9

        This is a little disappointing... but overall the Gradle Kotlin DSL is pretty cool and works pretty well in
        Intellij.

        UPDATE 2020-05-31 Yes it looks like there is an official word on this topic. The activity of configuring a
        sub-project is defined as "cross-configuring" (https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#sec:kotlin_cross_project_configuration)
        The note in that article says "Taking this approach means that you wonâ€™t be able to use type-safe accessors for
        model elements contributed by the plugins. You will instead have to rely on string literals and the standard
        Gradle APIs." So there you have it: cross-configuring is a significant trade-off that might make your
        project's build files more DRY/expressive but limits the ability of the Gradle Kotlin DSL to bring type-safety to
        those very same build files.
